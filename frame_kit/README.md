## PicoFrame Frame kit

These files allow the Inky Frame 7.3" to displayed in a picture frame. It consists of 5 files. They were designed to be laser cut.

1. [InkyFrame_7.3_Glass.svg](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ipzZO23xBU7-inkyframe73glass)
  This replaces the glass panel and allows access to the front facing buttons.

2. [InkyFrame_7.3_Frame_Mount.svg](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iCAjfUwoXZl-inkyframe73framemount)
  This is a frame mount to hide the pcb.

3. [InkyFrame_7.3_Spacer.svg](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fhD4mlg99oc-inkyframe73spacer)
  This is a spacer that goes between the frame mount and Inky Frame so that the Inky Frame sits flush with the frame mount.

4. [InkyFrame_7.3_Latches.svg](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6E6DJKAskuz-inkyframe73latches)
  These allow the Inky Frame to stay instead of frame and can be added where ever theres space.

5. [InkyFrame_7.3_Back.svg](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eloPaItMiAw-inkyframe73back)
  This is a back piece that is optional. However it does let the latches sit flush with the inset.

## What you need

1. A frame. This has been designed for a 20x15cm frame. [Here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09B9XT2C5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) is the one I used. I am not sure if its compatible with any other frames of that size

3. 4x M2 nuts

4. 4x M2 washers

5. 3x sheets of 1mm clear acrylic bigger than 20x15cm
